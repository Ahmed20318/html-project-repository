    <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">1. AI in Marketing</h2>
  
    <P1 style="color: rgb(253, 251, 251);"> 
<br> Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is there solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!</br>
<br> In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product. But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item. It’s like these search engines are reading our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. An example of this is finding the right movies on Netflix.</br>
<br> One reason why we’re all obsessed with Netflix and chill is because, Netflix provides highly accurate predictive technology based on customer’s reactions to films. It examines millions of records to suggest shows and films that you might like based on your previous actions and choices of films. As the data set grows, this technology is getting smarter and smarter every day. </br>
<br> With the growing advancement in AI, in the near future, it may be possible for consumers on the web to buy products by snapping a photo of it. Companies like CamFind and their competitors are experimenting this already. </br>
</p1>

<h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">2. AI in Banking </h2>

<P1 style="color: rgb(253, 251, 251);"> 
<br> AI in banking is growing faster than you thought! A lot of banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, detect anomalies and credit card frauds. An example of this is HDFC Bank. </br>
<br> HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), built by Bengaluru-based Senseforth AI Research. </br>
   <br> Since its launch, Eva has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations. Eva can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds.</br>
<br>The use of AI for fraud prevention is not a new concept. In fact, AI solutions are there to enhance security across a number of business sectors, including retail and finance. </br>
<br>By tracing card usage and endpoint access, security specialists are more effectively preventing fraud. Organizations rely on AI to trace those steps by analyzing the behaviors of transactions. </br>
<br>Companies such as MasterCard and RBS WorldPay have relied on AI and Deep Learning to detect fraudulent transaction patterns and prevent card fraud for years now. This has saved millions of dollars. </br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">3. AI in Health Care</h2>

<P1 style="color: rgb(253, 251, 251);"> 
<br> When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI. There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.</br>
<br>An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke. </br>
<br> Another such example is Coala life which is a company that has a digitalized device that can find cardiac diseases. </br>
<br>Similarly, Aifloo is developing a system for keeping track of how people are doing in nursing homes, home care, etc. The best thing about AI in healthcare is that you don’t even need to develop a new medication. Just by using an existing medication in the right way, you can also save lives.</br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">4. AI in Navigation</h2>
   <p1>Based on research from MIT, GPS technology can provide users with accurate, timely, and detailed information to improve safety. The technology uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network, which makes lives easier for users by automatically detecting the number of lanes and road types behind obstructions on the roads. AI is heavily used by Uber and many logistics companies to improve operational efficiency, analyze road traffic, and optimize routes.</p1>
   <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">5. AI in Robotics</h2>
   <p1>Robotics is another field where artificial intelligence applications are commonly used. Robots powered by AI use real-time updates to sense obstacles in its path and pre-plan its journey instantly. 

    It can be used for -
    
    Carrying goods in hospitals, factories, and warehouses
    Cleaning offices and large equipment
    Inventory management</p1>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 253);">6. AI in Human Resource</h2>
    <P1 style="color: rgb(253, 251, 251);"> 
       <br>
       Did you know that companies use intelligent software to ease the hiring process? </br>

    Artificial Intelligence helps with blind hiring. Using machine learning software, you can examine applications based on specific parameters. AI drive systems can scan job candidates' profiles, and resumes to provide recruiters an understanding of the talent pool they must choose from. </p1>
